### Hello, and welcome to MixUp!

## What is MixUp?
MixUp is a file-sharing website dedicated towards collaboration between musicians and producers. It allows users to create a 'track', which is a publicly available group of files to be shared between artists working on the same project. 

Any logged-in user can create a track, and in doing so, mark that track as 'open for remixes'. For tracks open for remixes, any user will be able to create a copy of that track and take the preexisting track in any direction they'd like. During track creation, users will also be able to add collaborators, who are able to directly manipulate the original track's file-list. 

Moving forward, I have a few more features that I would like to implement:
- 
- Toggleable Light/Dark themes
- User profile pages
- Auto-complete add collaborator box
- Custom designed HTML Audio element
- Main track file to give an example of what the whole track sounds like
